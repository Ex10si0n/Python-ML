# Implementation of Neural Networks from scratch

In the past 10 years, the best-performing artificial-intelligence systems ‚Äî such as the speech recognizers on smartphones or Google‚Äôs latest automatic translator ‚Äî have resulted from a technique called ‚ÄúDeep Learning.‚Äù

Deep learning is in fact a new name for an approach to artificial intelligence called neural networks, which have been going in and out of fashion for more than 70 years. **Neural networks** were first proposed in 1944 by Warren McCullough and Walter Pitts.

**Neural network** is an interconnected group of nodes, inspired by a simplification of neurons in a brain. It works similarly to the human brain‚Äôs neural network. A ‚Äúneuron‚Äù in a neural network is a mathematical function that collects and classifies information according to a specific architecture. The network bears a strong resemblance to statistical methods such as curve fitting and regression analysis.&#x20;

In this course, we‚Äôll understand how neural networks work while implementing one from scratch in Python.

### 1. Building Blocks: Neurons <a href="#1-building-blocks-neurons" id="1-building-blocks-neurons"></a>

First, we have to talk about neurons, the basic unit of a neural network. **A neuron takes inputs, does some math with them, and produces one output**. Here‚Äôs what a 2-input neuron looks like:

![](https://victorzhou.com/a74a19dc0599aae11df7493c718abaf9/perceptron.svg)

3 things are happening here. First, each input is multiplied by a weight:&#x20;

$$
x_1 \rightarrow x_1 * w_1
$$

$$
x_2 \rightarrow x_2 * w_2
$$

Next, all the weighted inputs are added together with a bias bb:&#x20;

$$
(x_1 * w_1) + (x_2 * w_2) + b
$$

Finally, the sum is passed through an activation function:&#x20;

$$
y = f(x_1 * w_1 + x_2 * w_2 + b)
$$

The activation function is used to turn an unbounded input into an output that has a nice, predictable form. A commonly used activation function is the [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid\_function) function:

![Sigmoid function](https://victorzhou.com/static/dd5a39500acbef371d8d791d2cd381e0/39600/sigmoid.png)

The sigmoid function only outputs numbers in the range (0, 1)(0,1). You can think of it as compressing(‚àí‚àû,+‚àû) to (0, 1) - big negative numbers become \~0, and big positive numbers become \~1.

#### A Simple Example <a href="#a-simple-example" id="a-simple-example"></a>

Assume we have a 2-input neuron that uses the sigmoid activation function and has the following parameters:

$$
w = [0, 1]
$$

$$
b = 4
$$

w = \[0, 1] is just a way of writing&#x20;

$$
w_1 = 0, w_2 = 1
$$

in vector form. Now, let‚Äôs give the neuron an input of x = \[2, 3]. We‚Äôll use the [dot product](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot\_product) to write things more concisely:

$$
(w‚ãÖx)+b ‚Äã=((w 1 ‚Äã ‚àóx 1 ‚Äã )+(w 2 ‚Äã ‚àóx 2 ‚Äã ))+b = 0 \times 2 + 1\times 3 + 4 = 7
$$

$$
y = f(w \cdot x + b) = f(7) = 0.999
$$

The neuron outputs 0.999 given the inputs x = \[2, 3]. That‚Äôs it! This process of passing inputs forward to get an output is known as **feedforward**.

#### Coding a Neuron <a href="#coding-a-neuron" id="coding-a-neuron"></a>

Time to implement a neuron! We‚Äôll use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), a popular and powerful computing library for Python, to help us do math:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
  # Our activation function: f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
  return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

class Neuron:
  def __init__(self, weights, bias):
    self.weights = weights
    self.bias = bias

  def feedforward(self, inputs):
    # Weight inputs, add bias, then use the activation function
    total = np.dot(self.weights, inputs) + self.bias
    return sigmoid(total)

weights = np.array([0, 1]) # w1 = 0, w2 = 1
bias = 4                   # b = 4
n = Neuron(weights, bias)

x = np.array([2, 3])       # x1 = 2, x2 = 3
print(n.feedforward(x))    # 0.9990889488055994
```

Recognize those numbers? That‚Äôs the example we just did! We get the same answer of 0.999.

### 2. Combining Neurons into a Neural Network <a href="#2-combining-neurons-into-a-neural-network" id="2-combining-neurons-into-a-neural-network"></a>

A neural network is nothing more than a bunch of neurons connected together. Here‚Äôs what a simple neural network might look like:

![](https://victorzhou.com/77ed172fdef54ca1ffcfb0bba27ba334/network.svg)

This network has 2 inputs, a hidden layer with 2 neurons (h\_1h1‚Äã and h\_2h2‚Äã), and an output layer with 1 neuron (o\_1o1‚Äã). Notice that the inputs for o\_1o1‚Äã are the outputs from h\_1h1‚Äã and h\_2h2‚Äã - that‚Äôs what makes this a network.

> A **hidden layer** is any layer between the input (first) layer and output (last) layer. There can be multiple hidden layers!

#### An Example: Feedforward <a href="#an-example-feedforward" id="an-example-feedforward"></a>

Let‚Äôs use the network pictured above and assume all neurons have the same weights w = \[0, 1]w=\[0,1], the same bias b = 0b=0, and the same sigmoid activation function. Let h\_1, h\_2, o\_1h1‚Äã,h2‚Äã,o1‚Äã denote the _outputs_ of the neurons they represent.

What happens if we pass in the input x = \[2, 3]?

$$
\begin{aligned} h_1 = h_2 &= f(w \cdot x + b) \\ &= f((0 * 2) + (1 * 3) + 0) \\ &= f(3) \\ &= 0.9526 \\ \end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned} o_1 &= f(w \cdot [h_1, h_2] + b) \\ &= f((0 \times h-1) + (1 \times h_2) + 0) \\ &= f(0.9526) \\ &= 0.7216 \\ \end{aligned}
$$

The output of the neural network for input x = \[2, 3] is 0.7216. Pretty simple, right?

A neural network can have **any number of layers** with **any number of neurons** in those layers. The basic idea stays the same: feed the input(s) forward through the neurons in the network to get the output(s) at the end. For simplicity, we‚Äôll keep using the network pictured above for the rest of this post.

#### Coding a Neural Network: Feedforward <a href="#coding-a-neural-network-feedforward" id="coding-a-neural-network-feedforward"></a>

Let‚Äôs implement feedforward for our neural network. Here‚Äôs the image of the network again for reference:

![](https://victorzhou.com/77ed172fdef54ca1ffcfb0bba27ba334/network.svg)

```python
import numpy as np

# ... code from previous section here

class OurNeuralNetwork:
  '''
  A neural network with:
    - 2 inputs
    - a hidden layer with 2 neurons (h1, h2)
    - an output layer with 1 neuron (o1)
  Each neuron has the same weights and bias:
    - w = [0, 1]
    - b = 0
  '''
  def __init__(self):
    weights = np.array([0, 1])
    bias = 0

    # The Neuron class here is from the previous section
    self.h1 = Neuron(weights, bias)
    self.h2 = Neuron(weights, bias)
    self.o1 = Neuron(weights, bias)

  def feedforward(self, x):
    out_h1 = self.h1.feedforward(x)
    out_h2 = self.h2.feedforward(x)

    # The inputs for o1 are the outputs from h1 and h2
    out_o1 = self.o1.feedforward(np.array([out_h1, out_h2]))

    return out_o1

network = OurNeuralNetwork()
x = np.array([2, 3])
print(network.feedforward(x)) # 0.7216325609518421
```

We got 0.7216 again! Looks like it works.

### 3. Training a Neural Network, Part 1 <a href="#3-training-a-neural-network-part-1" id="3-training-a-neural-network-part-1"></a>

Say we have the following measurements:

| Name    | Weight (lb) | Height (in) | Gender |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Alice   | 133         | 65          | F      |
| Bob     | 160         | 72          | M      |
| Charlie | 152         | 70          | M      |
| Diana   | 120         | 60          | F      |

Let‚Äôs train our network to predict someone‚Äôs gender given their weight and height:

![](https://victorzhou.com/965173626f97e1e6b497a136d0c14ec1/network2.svg)

We‚Äôll represent Male with a 00 and Female with a 11, and we‚Äôll also shift the data to make it easier to use:

| Name    | Weight (minus 135) | Height (minus 66) | Gender |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------ |
| Alice   | -2                 | -1                | 1      |
| Bob     | 25                 | 6                 | 0      |
| Charlie | 17                 | 4                 | 0      |
| Diana   | -15                | -6                | 1      |

> I arbitrarily chose the shift amounts (135 and 66) to make the numbers look nice. Normally, you‚Äôd shift by the mean.

#### Loss <a href="#loss" id="loss"></a>

Before we train our network, we first need a way to quantify how ‚Äúgood‚Äù it‚Äôs doing so that it can try to do ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. That‚Äôs what the **loss** is.

We‚Äôll use the **mean squared error** (MSE) loss:

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_{true} - y_{pred})^2
$$

Let‚Äôs break this down:

* n is the number of samples, which is 4 (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana).
* y represents the variable being predicted, which is Gender.
* y\_{true}‚Äã is the _true_ value of the variable (the ‚Äúcorrect answer‚Äù). For example, y\_{true}‚Äã for Alice would be 1 (Female).
* y\_{pred}‚Äã is the _predicted_ value of the variable. It‚Äôs whatever our network outputs.

$$
(y_{true} - y_{pred})^2
$$

is known as the **squared error**. Our loss function is simply taking the average over all squared errors (hence the name _mean_ squared error). The better our predictions are, the lower our loss will be!

Better predictions = Lower loss.

**Training a network = trying to minimize its loss.**

#### An Example Loss Calculation <a href="#an-example-loss-calculation" id="an-example-loss-calculation"></a>

Let‚Äôs say our network always outputs 0 - in other words, it‚Äôs confident all humans are Male ü§î. What would our loss be?

| Name    | y\_{true}ytrue‚Äã | y\_{pred}ypred‚Äã | (y\_{true} - y\_{pred})^2(ytrue‚Äã‚àíypred‚Äã)2 |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Alice   | 1               | 0               | 1                                         |
| Bob     | 0               | 0               | 0                                         |
| Charlie | 0               | 0               | 0                                         |
| Diana   | 1               | 0               | 1                                         |

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{4} (1 + 0 + 0 + 1) = \boxed{0.5}
$$

#### Code: MSE Loss <a href="#code-mse-loss" id="code-mse-loss"></a>

Here‚Äôs some code to calculate loss for us:

```python
import numpy as np

def mse_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  # y_true and y_pred are numpy arrays of the same length.
  return ((y_true - y_pred) ** 2).mean()

y_true = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0])

print(mse_loss(y_true, y_pred)) # 0.5
```

If you don't understand why this code works, read the NumPy [quickstart](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html#basic-operations) on array operations.

Nice. Onwards!

### 4. Training a Neural Network, Part 2 <a href="#4-training-a-neural-network-part-2" id="4-training-a-neural-network-part-2"></a>

We now have a clear goal: **minimize the loss** of the neural network. We know we can change the network‚Äôs weights and biases to influence its predictions, but how do we do so in a way that decreases loss?

> This section uses a bit of multivariable calculus. If you‚Äôre not comfortable with calculus, feel free to skip over the math parts.

For simplicity, let‚Äôs pretend we only have Alice in our dataset:

| Name  | Weight (minus 135) | Height (minus 66) | Gender |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------ |
| Alice | -2                 | -1                | 1      |

Then the mean squared error loss is just Alice‚Äôs squared error:

$$
\begin{aligned} \text{MSE} &= \frac{1}{1} \sum_{i=1}^1 (y_{true} - y_{pred})^2 \\ &= (y_{true} - y_{pred})^2 \\ &= (1 - y_{pred})^2 \\ \end{aligned}
$$

Another way to think about loss is as a function of weights and biases. Let‚Äôs label each weight and bias in our network:

![](https://victorzhou.com/27cf280166d7159c0465a58c68f99b39/network3.svg)

Then, we can write loss as a multivariable function:

$$
L(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, w_6, b_1, b_2, b_3‚Äã)
$$

\>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> CONTINUE HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Imagine we wanted to tweak w\_1w1‚Äã. How would loss LL change if we changed w\_1w1‚Äã? That‚Äôs a question the [partial derivative](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial\_derivative) \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã can answer. How do we calculate it?

> Here‚Äôs where the math starts to get more complex. **Don‚Äôt be discouraged!** I recommend getting a pen and paper to follow along - it‚Äôll help you understand.

To start, let‚Äôs rewrite the partial derivative in terms of \frac{\partial y\_{pred\}}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇypred‚Äã‚Äã instead:

\frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y\_{pred\}} \* \frac{\partial y\_{pred\}}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã=‚àÇypred‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã‚àó‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇypred‚Äã‚ÄãThis works because of the [Chain Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain\_rule).

We can calculate \frac{\partial L}{\partial y\_{pred\}}‚àÇypred‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã because we computed L = (1 - y\_{pred})^2L=(1‚àíypred‚Äã)2 above:

\frac{\partial L}{\partial y\_{pred\}} = \frac{\partial (1 - y\_{pred})^2}{\partial y\_{pred\}} = \boxed{-2(1 - y\_{pred})}‚àÇypred‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã=‚àÇypred‚Äã‚àÇ(1‚àíypred‚Äã)2‚Äã=‚àí2(1‚àíypred‚Äã)‚Äã

Now, let‚Äôs figure out what to do with \frac{\partial y\_{pred\}}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇypred‚Äã‚Äã. Just like before, let h\_1, h\_2, o\_1h1‚Äã,h2‚Äã,o1‚Äã be the outputs of the neurons they represent. Then

y\_{pred} = o\_1 = f(w\_5h\_1 + w\_6h\_2 + b\_3)ypred‚Äã=o1‚Äã=f(w5‚Äãh1‚Äã+w6‚Äãh2‚Äã+b3‚Äã)f is the sigmoid activation function, remember?

Since w\_1w1‚Äã only affects h\_1h1‚Äã (not h\_2h2‚Äã), we can write

\frac{\partial y\_{pred\}}{\partial w\_1} = \frac{\partial y\_{pred\}}{\partial h\_1} \* \frac{\partial h\_1}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇypred‚Äã‚Äã=‚àÇh1‚Äã‚àÇypred‚Äã‚Äã‚àó‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇh1‚Äã‚Äã\frac{\partial y\_{pred\}}{\partial h\_1} = \boxed{w\_5 \* f'(w\_5h\_1 + w\_6h\_2 + b\_3)}‚àÇh1‚Äã‚àÇypred‚Äã‚Äã=w5‚Äã‚àóf‚Ä≤(w5‚Äãh1‚Äã+w6‚Äãh2‚Äã+b3‚Äã)‚ÄãMore Chain Rule.

We do the same thing for \frac{\partial h\_1}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇh1‚Äã‚Äã:

h\_1 = f(w\_1x\_1 + w\_2x\_2 + b\_1)h1‚Äã=f(w1‚Äãx1‚Äã+w2‚Äãx2‚Äã+b1‚Äã)\frac{\partial h\_1}{\partial w\_1} = \boxed{x\_1 \* f'(w\_1x\_1 + w\_2x\_2 + b\_1)}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇh1‚Äã‚Äã=x1‚Äã‚àóf‚Ä≤(w1‚Äãx1‚Äã+w2‚Äãx2‚Äã+b1‚Äã)‚ÄãYou guessed it, Chain Rule.

x\_1x1‚Äã here is weight, and x\_2x2‚Äã is height. This is the second time we‚Äôve seen f'(x)f‚Ä≤(x) (the derivate of the sigmoid function) now! Let‚Äôs derive it:

f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x\}}f(x)=1+e‚àíx1‚Äãf'(x) = \frac{e^{-x\}}{(1 + e^{-x})^2} = f(x) \* (1 - f(x))f‚Ä≤(x)=(1+e‚àíx)2e‚àíx‚Äã=f(x)‚àó(1‚àíf(x))

We‚Äôll use this nice form for f'(x)f‚Ä≤(x) later.

We‚Äôre done! We‚Äôve managed to break down \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã into several parts we can calculate:

\boxed{\frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y\_{pred\}} \* \frac{\partial y\_{pred\}}{\partial h\_1} \* \frac{\partial h\_1}{\partial w\_1\}}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã=‚àÇypred‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã‚àó‚àÇh1‚Äã‚àÇypred‚Äã‚Äã‚àó‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇh1‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

This system of calculating partial derivatives by working backwards is known as **backpropagation**, or ‚Äúbackprop‚Äù.

Phew. That was a lot of symbols - it‚Äôs alright if you‚Äôre still a bit confused. Let‚Äôs do an example to see this in action!

#### Example: Calculating the Partial Derivative <a href="#example-calculating-the-partial-derivative" id="example-calculating-the-partial-derivative"></a>

We‚Äôre going to continue pretending only Alice is in our dataset:

| Name  | Weight (minus 135) | Height (minus 66) | Gender |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------ |
| Alice | -2                 | -1                | 1      |

Let‚Äôs initialize all the weights to 11 and all the biases to 00. If we do a feedforward pass through the network, we get:

\begin{aligned} h\_1 &= f(w\_1x\_1 + w\_2x\_2 + b\_1) \\\ &= f(-2 + -1 + 0) \\\ &= 0.0474 \\\ \end{aligned}h1‚Äã‚Äã=f(w1‚Äãx1‚Äã+w2‚Äãx2‚Äã+b1‚Äã)=f(‚àí2+‚àí1+0)=0.0474‚Äãh\_2 = f(w\_3x\_1 + w\_4x\_2 + b\_2) = 0.0474h2‚Äã=f(w3‚Äãx1‚Äã+w4‚Äãx2‚Äã+b2‚Äã)=0.0474\begin{aligned} o\_1 &= f(w\_5h\_1 + w\_6h\_2 + b\_3) \\\ &= f(0.0474 + 0.0474 + 0) \\\ &= 0.524 \\\ \end{aligned}o1‚Äã‚Äã=f(w5‚Äãh1‚Äã+w6‚Äãh2‚Äã+b3‚Äã)=f(0.0474+0.0474+0)=0.524‚Äã

The network outputs y\_{pred} = 0.524ypred‚Äã=0.524, which doesn‚Äôt strongly favor Male (00) or Female (11). Let‚Äôs calculate \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã:

\frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y\_{pred\}} \* \frac{\partial y\_{pred\}}{\partial h\_1} \* \frac{\partial h\_1}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã=‚àÇypred‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã‚àó‚àÇh1‚Äã‚àÇypred‚Äã‚Äã‚àó‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇh1‚Äã‚Äã\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial L}{\partial y\_{pred\}} &= -2(1 - y\_{pred}) \\\ &= -2(1 - 0.524) \\\ &= -0.952 \\\ \end{aligned}‚àÇypred‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã‚Äã=‚àí2(1‚àíypred‚Äã)=‚àí2(1‚àí0.524)=‚àí0.952‚Äã\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial y\_{pred\}}{\partial h\_1} &= w\_5 \* f'(w\_5h\_1 + w\_6h\_2 + b\_3) \\\ &= 1 \* f'(0.0474 + 0.0474 + 0) \\\ &= f(0.0948) \* (1 - f(0.0948)) \\\ &= 0.249 \\\ \end{aligned}‚àÇh1‚Äã‚àÇypred‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã=w5‚Äã‚àóf‚Ä≤(w5‚Äãh1‚Äã+w6‚Äãh2‚Äã+b3‚Äã)=1‚àóf‚Ä≤(0.0474+0.0474+0)=f(0.0948)‚àó(1‚àíf(0.0948))=0.249‚Äã\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial h\_1}{\partial w\_1} &= x\_1 \* f'(w\_1x\_1 + w\_2x\_2 + b\_1) \\\ &= -2 \* f'(-2 + -1 + 0) \\\ &= -2 \* f(-3) \* (1 - f(-3)) \\\ &= -0.0904 \\\ \end{aligned}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇh1‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã=x1‚Äã‚àóf‚Ä≤(w1‚Äãx1‚Äã+w2‚Äãx2‚Äã+b1‚Äã)=‚àí2‚àóf‚Ä≤(‚àí2+‚àí1+0)=‚àí2‚àóf(‚àí3)‚àó(1‚àíf(‚àí3))=‚àí0.0904‚Äã\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1} &= -0.952 \* 0.249 \* -0.0904 \\\ &= \boxed{0.0214} \\\ \end{aligned}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã‚Äã=‚àí0.952‚àó0.249‚àó‚àí0.0904=0.0214‚Äã‚Äã

> Reminder: we derived f'(x) = f(x) \* (1 - f(x))f‚Ä≤(x)=f(x)‚àó(1‚àíf(x)) for our sigmoid activation function earlier.

We did it! This tells us that if we were to increase w\_1w1‚Äã, LL would increase a _tiiiny_ bit as a result.

#### Training: Stochastic Gradient Descent <a href="#training-stochastic-gradient-descent" id="training-stochastic-gradient-descent"></a>

**We have all the tools we need to train a neural network now!** We‚Äôll use an optimization algorithm called [stochastic gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic\_gradient\_descent) (SGD) that tells us how to change our weights and biases to minimize loss. It‚Äôs basically just this update equation:

w\_1 \leftarrow w\_1 - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1}w1‚Äã‚Üêw1‚Äã‚àíŒ∑‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã

\etaŒ∑ is a constant called the **learning rate** that controls how fast we train. All we‚Äôre doing is subtracting \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1}Œ∑‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã from w\_1w1‚Äã:

* If \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã is positive, w\_1w1‚Äã will decrease, which makes LL decrease.
* If \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã is negative, w\_1w1‚Äã will increase, which makes LL decrease.

If we do this for every weight and bias in the network, the loss will slowly decrease and our network will improve.

Our training process will look like this:

1. Choose **one** sample from our dataset. This is what makes it _stochastic_ gradient descent - we only operate on one sample at a time.
2. Calculate all the partial derivatives of loss with respect to weights or biases (e.g. \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_1}‚àÇw1‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w\_2}‚àÇw2‚Äã‚àÇL‚Äã, etc).
3. Use the update equation to update each weight and bias.
4. Go back to step 1.

Let‚Äôs see it in action!

It‚Äôs _finally_ time to implement a complete neural network:

| Name    | Weight (minus 135) | Height (minus 66) | Gender |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------ |
| Alice   | -2                 | -1                | 1      |
| Bob     | 25                 | 6                 | 0      |
| Charlie | 17                 | 4                 | 0      |
| Diana   | -15                | -6                | 1      |

Our loss steadily decreases as the network learns:

![loss](https://victorzhou.com/static/99e7886af56d6f41b484d17a52f9241b/4dbef/loss.png)

We can now use the network to predict genders:

```python
# Make some predictions
emily = np.array([-7, -3]) # 128 pounds, 63 inches
frank = np.array([20, 2])  # 155 pounds, 68 inches
print("Emily: %.3f" % network.feedforward(emily)) # 0.951 - F
print("Frank: %.3f" % network.feedforward(frank)) # 0.039 - M
```

### Now What? <a href="#now-what" id="now-what"></a>

You made it! A quick recap of what we did:

* Introduced **neurons**, the building blocks of neural networks.
* Used the **sigmoid activation function** in our neurons.
* Saw that neural networks are just neurons connected together.
* Created a dataset with Weight and Height as inputs (or **features**) and Gender as the output (or **label**).
* Learned about **loss functions** and the **mean squared error** (MSE) loss.
* Realized that training a network is just minimizing its loss.
* Used **backpropagation** to calculate partial derivatives.
* Used **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD) to train our network.

There‚Äôs still much more to do:

* Experiment with bigger / better neural networks using proper machine learning libraries like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [Keras](https://keras.io), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
* [Build your first neural network with Keras](https://victorzhou.com/blog/keras-neural-network-tutorial/).
* Read the rest of my [Neural Networks from Scratch](https://victorzhou.com/series/neural-networks-from-scratch/) series.
* Tinker with [a neural network in your browser](https://playground.tensorflow.org).
* Discover [other activation functions](https://keras.io/activations/) besides sigmoid, like [Softmax](https://victorzhou.com/blog/softmax/).
* Discover [other optimizers](https://keras.io/optimizers/) besides SGD.
* Read my [introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/) (CNNs). CNNs revolutionized the field of [Computer Vision](https://victorzhou.com/tag/computer-vision/) and can be extremely powerful.
* Read my [introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-rnns/) (RNNs), which are often used for [Natural Language Processing](https://victorzhou.com/tag/natural-language-processing/) (NLP).
