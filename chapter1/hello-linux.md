# Hello Linux

Linux is a family **of free and open-source operating systems based** on the Linux kernel. Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others.

Here is the Family tree of all computer Operating Systems, in comparison of macOS and Windows with Linux, we can refer the classification by the OS family tree.

In short, by traversal the tree, we will get the path of some of the famous OS:

```
macOS: Unix(AT&T/Bell Labs) -> BSD -> NeXT -> darwin -> macOS Monterey
iOS: Unix(AT&T/Bell Labs) -> BSD -> NeXT -> darwin -> macOS -> iOS
Windows: OS/2(IBM/Microsoft) -> Windows NT 3.X -> Windows 11
Windows Server: OS/2(IBM/Microsoft) -> Windows NT 3.X -> Windows Server
Ubuntu: Linux -> Debian (GNU) -> Ubuntu
CentOS: Linux -> Red Hat -> CentOS
Android: Linux -> Android
```

Similar to macOS or Windows, there also be many of the OS(Ubuntu, CentOS, Android) runs on computers (boarderly speaking, term computers including mobile phone, PC, server and embeded). So, Linux is a bunch of OS. In the hierarchical structure, Linux is the same level of Unix while Ubuntu, CentOS (refer as Linux distro) are in the same level of macOS and Windows.

Back to our topic, due to these Linux distros are based on Linux, although there are a little bit different between these distros, the basic file structures are almost the same. Moreover, Linux has been increasingly deployed in more and more servers rather than Windows server nowadays, it is worth-learning.

In the first Chapter, I arranged a few goals that you will achieve while learning using Linux. So let’s get started to make your hands dirty!

### Installation of Linux

There are many approaches to let us manipulate on Linux:

> 1. Use other’s computer (Cloud Computing)
>    1. Cloud Computing Platforms
>    2. Find a free Linux server
>    3. Hack into someone’s computers (not recommended)
> 2. Use your own computer&#x20;
>    1. You are just using Linux or Unix(macOS)
>    2. Local installation of a Linux distro
>    3. Virtual Machines (Visualization)
>    4. Docker, WSL (Containerization)
