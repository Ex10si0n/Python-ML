# Hello Linux

Linux is a family **of free and open-source operating systems based** on the Linux kernel. Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others.

Here is the Family tree of all computer Operating Systems, in comparison to macOS and Windows with Linux, we can refer to the classification by the OS family tree.

In short, by traversal the tree, we will get the path of some of the famous OS:

```bash
macOS: Unix(AT&T/Bell Labs) -> BSD -> NeXT -> darwin -> macOS Monterey
iOS: Unix(AT&T/Bell Labs) -> BSD -> NeXT -> darwin -> macOS -> iOS
Windows: OS/2(IBM/Microsoft) -> Windows NT 3.X -> Windows 11
Windows Server: OS/2(IBM/Microsoft) -> Windows NT 3.X -> Windows Server
Ubuntu: Linux -> Debian (GNU) -> Ubuntu
CentOS: Linux -> Red Hat -> CentOS
Android: Linux -> Android
```

Similar to macOS or Windows, there also be many of the OS(Ubuntu, CentOS, Android) run on computers (broader speaking, term computers including mobile phone, PC, server and embedded). So, Linux is a bunch of OS. In the hierarchical structure, Linux is at the same level as Unix while Ubuntu, CentOS (refer as Linux distro) is at the same level as macOS and Windows.

Back to our topic, these Linux distros are based on Linux, although there are a few bit differences between these distros, the basic file structures are almost the same. Moreover, Linux has been increasingly deployed on more and more servers rather than Windows servers nowadays, it is worth learning.

In the first Chapter, I arranged a few <mark style="color:green;">**goals**</mark> that you will achieve while learning using Linux. So let‚Äôs get started to make your hands dirty!

### Installation of Linux

There are many approaches to let us manipulate on Linux:

> 1. Use other‚Äôs computer (Cloud Computing)
>    1. Cloud Computing Platforms
>    2. Find a free Linux server
>    3. Hack into someone‚Äôs computers (not recommended)
> 2. Use your own computer
>    1. You are just using Linux or Unix(macOS) üëç
>    2. Local installation of a Linux distro
>    3. Virtual Machines (Visualization)
>    4. Docker, WSL (Containerization) üëç

> üëç Goal: let Linux runs on your computer.
