# conda: the Python environment manager

**Downloading conda:**

There are several ways to make `conda` runs on your computer. Here are two tastes, **Anaconda** is a data science toolkit all-in-one edition that makes sure you are ready to go once you have installed it. While **MiniForge** needs more configurations but it is pure and minimal, the package size is smaller, compared with Anaconda, MiniForge will only install `conda` for you.
